# Overall Testing Strategy

The plan is to separate tests into two categories: Unit Tests and Integration Tests. This separation ensures that we can test different aspects of the code effectively.

Unit Tests: These will form the majority of our tests. They will test each function (task) in complete isolation. All external dependencies—such as the filesystem (open), the LLM library (llm), and even the Prefect logger—will be "mocked" or faked.

Rationale: Unit tests are fast, deterministic, and reliable. By isolating a function, we can verify its internal logic without worrying about external systems. If a unit test fails, we know the bug is within that specific function, which makes debugging much easier.

Integration Tests: These tests will verify the interactions between our code and its immediate, direct dependencies. In this case, the most critical integration point is the connection to the llm library.

Rationale: While unit tests confirm our logic is correct, they don't confirm that we are using external libraries correctly. These tests will mock the LLM API call itself but will test that our code (e.g., summarize_content) correctly calls the llm library with the expected prompt format and correctly processes its response. This gives us confidence that our code "integrates" properly with the external tool.

## Required Libraries

To implement this plan, you will need to add the following libraries to your development dependencies:

```sh
pip install pytest pytest-mock pyfakefs
```

pytest: The testing framework.

pytest-mock: Provides a simple fixture (mocker) for patching objects and mocking dependencies.

pyfakefs: A fantastic library that lets us create a fake in-memory filesystem for testing file I/O without touching the actual disk.

## Suggested File Structure

A standard and clean way to organize your tests is as follows:

```
your_project/
├── my_prefect_flows/
│   └── tasks.py        # The file you provided
├── config/
│   └── blessed_tags.txt
└── tests/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── conftest.py       # Optional: for shared fixtures
    ├── unit/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── test_tasks_unit.py
    └── integration/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── test_tasks_integration.py
```

## Detailed Testing Plan & Examples

Here is a breakdown of the tests for each function.

1. `load_blessed_tags`

This function's main dependency is the filesystem. We will use pyfakefs to create virtual files for our tests.

Rationale: Using pyfakefs is superior to mocking the built-in open function because it correctly simulates a real filesystem environment. This allows us to test file paths, FileNotFoundError, and file content in a very realistic way without writing/deleting actual files on disk.

tests/unit/test_tasks_unit.py

```python
from my_prefect_flows.tasks import load_blessed_tags

# Using the 'fs' fixture provided by pyfakefs
def test_load_blessed_tags_success(fs):
    """
    Tests that blessed tags are loaded correctly from a valid file.
    """
    # Arrange: Create a fake file in the fake filesystem
    blessed_tags_path = "config/blessed_tags.txt"
    fs.create_file(blessed_tags_path, contents="python\nprefect\nai\n")

    # Act
    result = load_blessed_tags.fn(blessed_tags_path)

    # Assert
    assert result == {"python", "prefect", "ai"}

def test_load_blessed_tags_file_not_found(fs):
    """
    Tests that an empty set is returned when the file does not exist.
    """
    # Arrange: The file is not created in the fake filesystem

    # Act
    result = load_blessed_tags.fn("non_existent_file.txt")

    # Assert: The function should gracefully return an empty set.
    assert result == set()

def test_load_blessed_tags_with_empty_lines_and_whitespace(fs):
    """
    Tests that blank lines and extra whitespace are correctly handled.
    """
    # Arrange
    blessed_tags_path = "config/blessed_tags.txt"
    fs.create_file(blessed_tags_path, contents="  data-science  \n\n  mlops\n")

    # Act
    result = load_blessed_tags.fn(blessed_tags_path)

    # Assert
    assert result == {"data-science", "mlops"}
```

2. `extract_main_content`

This is a pure function that depends only on its input and BeautifulSoup. No mocking is needed. We can test it by providing different HTML snippets. pytest.mark.parametrize is perfect for this.

Rationale: We want to test the fallback logic: <article> -> <main> -> <body>. We also need to confirm that boilerplate tags (<nav>, <script>, etc.) are removed.

tests/unit/test_tasks_unit.py

```python
import pytest
from my_prefect_flows.tasks import extract_main_content

@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "html_input, expected_output",
    [
        # Test 1: Prefers <article> tag
        (
            "<body><header>Header</header><main>Main content</main><article>Article content</article></body>",
            "Article content",
        ),
        # Test 2: Falls back to <main> tag
        (
            "<body><nav>Navbar</nav><main>Main content is here</main><footer>Footer</footer></body>",
            "Main content is here",
        ),
        # Test 3: Falls back to <body> tag
        (
            "<body>Some body text<script>alert(1)</script></body>",
            "Some body text",
        ),
        # Test 4: Handles empty content
        (
            "<html><body></body></html>",
            "",
        ),
        # Test 5: Strips multiple boilerplate tags
        (
            "<body><nav>Nav</nav><div><h1>Title</h1><p>Real text</p></div><style>.a{}</style></body>",
            "Title Real text",
        ),
    ],
)
def test_extract_main_content(html_input, expected_output):
    """
    Tests the main content extraction logic with various HTML structures.
    """
    # Act
    result = extract_main_content.fn(html_input)

    # Assert
    assert result == expected_output
```

3. `lint_tags`

This is another pure function. We need to test its filtering logic.

tests/unit/test_tasks_unit.py

```python
from my_prefect_flows.tasks import lint_tags

def test_lint_tags_filters_unblessed_tags():
    """
    Tests that tags not in the blessed set are removed.
    """
    # Arrange
    input_tags = ["python", "gossip", "ai", "news"]
    blessed_tags = {"python", "ai", "prefect"}

    # Act
    result = lint_tags.fn(input_tags, blessed_tags)

    # Assert: Only the blessed tags should be in the result.
    assert result == ["python", "ai"]

def test_lint_tags_with_no_blessed_tags():
    """
    Tests that if the blessed set is empty, all original tags are returned.
    """
    # Arrange
    input_tags = ["python", "ai"]
    blessed_tags = set()

    # Act
    result = lint_tags.fn(input_tags, blessed_tags)

    # Assert: The original list of tags should be returned untouched.
    assert result == ["python", "ai"]

def test_lint_tags_all_tags_are_blessed():
    """
    Tests that no tags are removed if all are in the blessed set.
    """
    # Arrange
    input_tags = ["python", "ai"]
    blessed_tags = {"python", "ai", "prefect"}

    # Act
    result = lint_tags.fn(input_tags, blessed_tags)

    # Assert
    assert result == ["python", "ai"]
```

4. `summarize_content` & `suggest_tags`

These tasks interact with an external service (llm). Directly calling this service in tests is slow, expensive, and non-deterministic. We will use pytest-mock to replace get_llm_model with a fake "mock" object.

Rationale: This is our integration test. We are not testing the LLM's ability to summarize; we are testing that our code correctly:

Calls the llm library.

Builds the correct prompt string.

Processes the library's response.

tests/integration/test_tasks_integration.py

```python
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from my_prefect_flows.tasks import summarize_content, suggest_tags

def test_summarize_content_integration(mocker):
    """
    Tests that summarize_content formats the prompt correctly and returns the response.
    """
    # Arrange: Create a fake model and a fake response object
    mock_response = MagicMock()
    mock_response.text.return_value = "This is a concise summary."

    mock_model = MagicMock()
    mock_model.prompt.return_value = mock_response

    # Patch the get_llm_model function to return our fake model
    mocker.patch("my_prefect_flows.tasks.get_llm_model", return_value=mock_model)

    input_text = "This is a very long piece of text that needs to be summarized."

    # Act
    result = summarize_content.fn(input_text)

    # Assert
    assert result == "This is a concise summary."

    # Assert that the prompt was called correctly
    mock_model.prompt.assert_called_once()
    call_args, _ = mock_model.prompt.call_args
    prompt_text = call_args[0]
    assert "Please summarize the following content" in prompt_text
    assert input_text in prompt_text


def test_suggest_tags_integration(mocker):
    """
    Tests that suggest_tags formats the prompt and processes the space-separated response.
    """
    # Arrange
    mock_response = MagicMock()
    # Simulate a realistic LLM output with extra space and mixed case
    mock_response.text.return_value = "  python Ai distributed-systems "

    mock_model = MagicMock()
    mock_model.prompt.return_value = mock_response

    mocker.patch("my_prefect_flows.tasks.get_llm_model", return_value=mock_model)

    input_text = "Some text about AI and Python."

    # Act
    result = suggest_tags.fn(input_text)

    # Assert: Check that the output is correctly parsed
    assert result == ["python", "ai", "distributed-systems"]

    # Assert that the prompt was called correctly
    mock_model.prompt.assert_called_once()
    call_args, _ = mock_model.prompt.call_args
    prompt_text = call_args[0]
    assert "suggest 3-5 relevant tags" in prompt_text
    assert input_text in prompt_text
```

This plan provides a robust testing suite for your Prefect tasks, ensuring that each piece of logic is verified independently and that the integrations with external systems are behaving as expected.
